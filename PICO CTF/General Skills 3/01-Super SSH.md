Using a Secure Shell (SSH) is going to be pretty important. Can you `ssh` as `ctf-player` to `titan.picoctf.net` at port `58092` to get the flag? You'll also need the password `83dcefb7`. If asked, accept the fingerprint with `yes`. If your device doesn't have a shell, you can use: [https://webshell.picoctf.org](https://webshell.picoctf.org/) If you're not sure what a shell is, check out our Primer: [https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell](https://primer.picoctf.com/#_the_shell)

- How could you specify the port?
- Remember, passwords are hidden when typed into the shell
